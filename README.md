The site is adapted to communicate with Wasm contract on Shiden Network.

# HashLips NFT minting dapp üî•

This repo provides a nice and easy way for linking an existing Wasm NFT smart contract to this minting dapp.


## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Clone this project:

```sh
https://github.com/Maar-io/ink-mint-dapp
```

Make sure you have node.js and yarn installed and then run:

```sh
yarn install
```

Rut it on local with:
```sh
yarn start
```
## Usage ‚ÑπÔ∏è

In order to make use of this dapp, all you need to do is change the configurations to point to your smart contract as well as update the images and theme file.

For the most part all the changes will be in the `public` folder.


Note: this dapp is designed to work with this [PSP34 NFT smart contract](https://github.com/swanky-dapps/nft), that takes no parameters in the `mintNext()` function. But you can change that in the App.js file if you need to use functions like `mint()` which that takes 2 params.

## Configuration :factory:
To link up your existing smart contract, go to the `public/config/config.json` file and update the following fields to fit your smart contract, network and marketplace details. The cost field should be in wei.
There are a couple of other parameters in this file (left from EVM config), please ignore them but keep in config file.

```json
{
  "CONTRACT_ADDRESS": "b8QeEr72aJQKfaXcEDGwB5iwqGuF1b9oysHtj3nwMsdmgHa",
  "SCAN_LINK": "https://shiden.subscan.io/account/b8QeEr72aJQKfaXcEDGwB5iwqGuF1b9oysHtj3nwMsdmgHa",
  "NETWORK": {
    "NAME": "Shiden",
    "SYMBOL": "SDN",
    "ID": 336
  },
  "NFT_NAME": "ShidenGraffiti",
  "SYMBOL": "SHG",
  "MAX_SUPPLY": 100,
  "WEI_COST": "1000000000000000000",
  "DISPLAY_COST": 1,
  "MARKETPLACE": "SubWallet",
  "MARKETPLACE_LINK": "https://",
  "WS_PROVIDER": "wss://rpc.shiden.astar.network"
}
```
## Update Metadata
Make sure you copy your contract metadata.json from and paste it as `src/redux/blockchain/abi.json` file.

## Update Images
Now you will need to create and change 2 images and a gif in the `public/config/images` folder, 
* `bg.png`
* `example.gif`
* `logo.png`

## Update Theme
Next change the theme colors to your liking in the `public/config/theme.css` file.

```css
:root {
  --primary: #ebc908;
  --primary-text: #1a1a1a;
  --secondary: #ff1dec;
  --secondary-text: #ffffff;
  --accent: #ffffff;
  --accent-text: #000000;
}
```

## Favicon
Now you will need to create and change the `public/favicon.ico`, `public/logo192.png`, and
`public/logo512.png` to your brand images.

## Other
Remember to update the title and description the `public/index.html` file

```html
<title>Nerdy Coder Clones</title>
<meta name="description" content="Mint your Nerdy Coder Clone NFT" />
```

Also remember to update the short_name and name fields in the `public/manifest.json` file

```json
{
  "short_name": "NCC",
  "name": "Coder Clone NFT"
}
```

After all the changes you can run.

```sh
yarn start
```
